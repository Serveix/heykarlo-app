<h1>HeyKarlo - Android Application</h1>
<hr>
Basically, a car assistant COMPLETELY controlled by voice. Project created to start
exploring Java on Andoid and technologies like Bing Speech API with continious 
speech recognition and TTS. Needs "heykarlo-server" to work. It's a really unestable
version that probably would need to be redesigned but the idea was to reduce cellular phone
using while driving to prevent car accidents by making possible to do everything without having to
use hands or eyes on the phone AT ALL. I see this as the future, where these types of interactions
between humans and computers happen as a usual thing.
