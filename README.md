HeyKarlo - Android Application
<hr>
Basically, a car assistant fully controlled by voice. Project created to start
exploring Java on Andoid and technologies like Bing Speech API with continious 
speech recognition and TTS. Needs "heykarlo-server" to work. It's a really unestable
version that probably would need to be redesigned but the idea was to reduce cellular phone
using while driving to prevent car accidents.
